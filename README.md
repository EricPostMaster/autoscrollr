Verse 1:
Hello, it's me
I’m your overworked Christmas elf from two thousand and three
I’ve built so many things,
From Tamagotchis that beep nonstop
To spinners for fidgeting


Verse 2:
Hello, from the past,
I’m still making Pogs, believe it or not, but how long did that craze last?
Stack and slam, they said,
But now they’re in the attic
With Beanie Babies, left for dead.


Chorus 1:
Hello from the workshop floor!
I’m making Funko Pops galore!
But who are we kidding, we know they don't mean a thing
A status symbol right now; they're gath'ring dust in the spring
Oh, oooh, ohhhhhh


Verse 3:
Hello, I’m still here,
Making Furbies with those freaky eyes that haunt my dreams all year.
Who asked for this? Niiiiiightmare!
I build, I sweat, I toil, I fret,
For fads they'll soon forget.


Chorus 2:
Hello from the workshop floor!
Another toy they’ll soon ignore.
You know it's rushed through production because on TikTok it's rizz
But people don't understand that, it's tough in this biz...

Oh, why can’t they just play with blocks?
Or build cool stuff with Lincoln Logs?
No QR codes and no apps to pair,
Just something timeless and simple, like a teddy bear.
Oh, oooh, ohhhhhh
